## Usage Examples
### Instantiate a Client
```go
import (
    "context"
    uptime "github.com/uptime-com/rest-api-clients/golang/uptime"
)

clientConfig := &uptime.Config {
    Token:            "my-api-token",
    RateMilliseconds: 2000,
}

client, err := uptime.NewClient(clientConfig)
```

### Create a Check
```go
c := &uptime.Check {
    CheckType:     "HTTP",
    Address:       "https://uptime.com",
    Interval:      1,
    Threshold:     15,
    Locations:     []string{"US East", "GBR", "AUT"},
    ContactGroups: []string{"Default"},
    Tags:          []string{"testing"},
}

ctx := context.Background()
newCheck, response, err := client.Checks.Create(ctx, c)
```

### Get downtime statistics for a check
```go
pk := 478926
opt := &uptime.CheckStatsOptions{
	StartDate:              "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
	EndDate:                "2020-01-02T00:00:00Z",
	Location:               "US East",
	LocationsResponseTimes: true,
	IncludeAlerts:          true,
	Download:               false,
	PDF:                    false,
}
stats, response, err := client.Checks.Stats(context.Background(), pk, opt)
fmt.Printf("Check %d statistics: %d outage(s), %ds total downtime\n", pk, stats.Totals.Outages, stats.Totals.DowntimeSecs)
```

### Get a list of Outages
```go
options := &uptime.OutageListOptions {
    Ordering: "-created_at",
}

ctx := context.Background()
outages, resp, err := client.Outages.List(ctx, options)
```

### Delete a Tag
```go
tagId = 12345

ctx := context.Background()
resp, err := client.Tags.Delete(ctx, tagId)
```
